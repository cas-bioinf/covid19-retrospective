title: "Detailed disease progression of 88 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in the Czech Republic: A dataset and exploratory analysis" 
output: pdf_document
abstract: "We collected a multi-centric retrospective dataset of patients who were admitted to 10 hospitals in Czech Republic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The dataset contains baseline patient characteristics, breathing support required, pharmacological treatment received and multiple markers on daily resolution. To assess association between treatments, markers and patient outcomes we performed multiverse analysis, observing how the conclusions change between defensible choices of statistical model, predictors included in the model and other analytical degrees of freedom."

# Introduction 

The Covid-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has, as of September 2020 led to over 28 million cases and over 900 000 deaths. Proposed treatments include antivirals approved for other indications (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Umifenovir), Azithromycin, corticosteriods, immunoglobulins, Tocilizumab and convalescent plasma [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/8XWTUMUI; @http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/6Q8Z8VJR; TODO]. Currently, the only treatment that exhibited positive effects in randomized trials is the corticosteriod Dexamethasone for severe cases [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/IW6VZ53Q; http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/5VAKEW58]. While initially promising, Hydroxychloroquine has failed to show benefit for both hospitalized patients [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/9X3UH8ZM], as early treatment [@https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-4207] and as post-exposure profylaxis [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/7C23YCV5; http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/GMR9FX9Z]. Further, no improvement could be discerned when adding Azithromycin to Hydroxychloroquine therapy [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/BQLRZGTQ]. Similarly, Lopinavir/Ritonavir also did not show benefit [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/6I6GAVWU]. No benefit was observed for convalscent plasma [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/UEXLDJCB; http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/BHGT88US] For additional summary see (live review)   

In observational studies, Hydroxychloroquine was often found to be associated with better outcomes [e. g., @http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/WZPNBRYN; http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/4HR7MUJ6; http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/NXC9CDI9]

High IL-6, D-dimer values were observed to be associated with outcome and disease severity [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/ID7F3XIH].
Large study of electronic health records [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/ARTB8HYZ] showed TODO.

An ongoing challenge in evalutating Covid-19 treatments is that the analysis and interpretation of the data is often inappropriate or misleading, most notably interpreting lack of evidence due to small sample size as evidence of no effect [see e.g., @http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/5PZEEPJV; @http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/AZDZHLJV].



# Methods


## Data Collection
A convenience sample of patients... Patients over the age of 18 were included if they had PCR-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and were not participating in a clinical evaluation of any Covid-19 pharmacotherapy. Full protocol for data collection is attached in the supplementary material. The study was approved by the Ethical committees of TODO.

## Statistical analysis

Since many details of analysis may influence the conclusions made, we performed multiverse analysis [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/DXWM259V] and report results for all the hypothesis tested across multiple different models using both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms. For each model class we worked with several possible sets of adjustments and - where applicable - with multiple estimands of the outcome as different tasks require different estimands [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/MH797GNC]. All analysis wes performed in the R language [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/67XKBC2W], visualisations and data cleaning was run with the `tidyverse` package [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/8EWY8TKM]. Complete code for all analyses can be found at TODO.

First class of models are frequentist multistate models under the proportional hazards assumption as implemented in the `coxph` function from the `survival` package [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/I9UVTUJF].

`brms` package [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/7ER3ZSER]. The parametrization of the HMM is inspired by [@http://zotero.org/users/5567156/items/F9K2L5Q8] where an underlying continous process with given rates only between the neighbouring state and the transition matrix across all states is then computed as the total probability of transition across all possible paths.
